# Write React components in Elm

This package makes it easy to turn Elm code into React components.

Companies that use [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) in production usually start with a single component. So if you want to use Elm at work, start with a small experiment. Do people think it is nice? Do more! Do people think it sucks? Do less!

Read more about how to use Elm at work [here](http://elm-lang.org/blog/how-to-use-elm-at-work).

## Example

  - Clock &mdash; [Demo](http://evancz.github.io/react-elm-components) / [Code](example-elm0.19)



## Usage

After you have compiled an Elm program to JavaScript, you can embed it in React like this:

```javascript
import Elm from 'react-elm-components'
import { Todo } from '../dist/elm/todomvc.js'

function render() {
	return <Elm src={Todo} />
}
```


### Flags

Sometimes you want to give your Elm program some **flags** on start up. For example, maybe your `Todo` module needs to get an array of todos. You would write something like this:

```javascript
import Elm from 'react-elm-components'
import { Todo } from '../dist/elm/todomvc.js'

function render() {
	var flags = { todos: ["Get Milk", "Do Laundry"] };
	return <Elm src={Todo} flags={flags} />
}
```

These flags will be given to the Elm program, allowing you to do some setup work in JS first.


### JavaScript/Elm Interop

As your Elm program gets fancier, you will probably need to interact with JavaScript. We do this with [**ports**](http://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html). Think of these as holes in the side of an Elm program that let you pass messages back-and-forth.

So maybe we extend our `Todo` app to allow outsiders to register new tasks through the `todos` port. And maybe we also expose `numActiveTodos` so that the outsider can know how much work you have left. You would set it up like this:

```javascript
import Elm from 'react-elm-components'
import { Todo } from '../dist/elm/todomvc.js'

function render() {
	return <Elm src={Todo} ports={setupPorts} />
}

function setupPorts(ports) {
	ports.numActiveTodos.subscribe(function(n) {
		console.log(n);
	});

	ports.todos.send("Invent the Universe");
	ports.todos.send("Bake an Apple Pie");
}
```

In the `setupPorts` function, we first subscribe to the `numActiveTodos` port. Whenever the number of active todos changes, we will run that function and log the number on the console. After that, we send two values through the `todos` port. This will add both of these into the model *and* trigger the `numActiveTodos` callback twice.


## Advanced Usage

Once the Elm component is initialized, changing the `flags` and `ports` properties will do nothing. So here are some tricks that may help you out:

  1. If you want to reinitialize your Elm component, add a different `key` to the old and new components. This way old one is destroyed and replaced by the new one.
  2. If you want to mess with ports, you can save the `ports` object into your `state` and access it later.
  3. This package is super simple. Fewer than 20 lines. Check out the implementation and do it different if you want!


## Angular, Ember, etc.

If you want to embed Elm in Angular or Ember or whatever else, you are in luck!

[The implementation](index.js) is under 20 lines, mostly React-related. The important lines are basically running the following program at the correct time:

```javascript
var Elm = require('../dist/elm/todomvc.js');
var app = Elm.Todo.embed(node, flags);
setupPorts(app.ports)
```

So if you are interested in embedding Elm in something else, do the same trick!
